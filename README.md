==================================================
          Demo Linear Regression Project
==================================================

Description:
------------
This is a basic implementation of Linear Regression using Python. It is intended to demonstrate how to apply linear regression to a dataset, visualize results, and evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

What is Linear Regression?
--------------------------
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the best-fitting straight line through the data to predict future outcomes. It is used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Features:
---------
- Load and preprocess data
- Visualize data using matplotlib/seaborn
- Train linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluate model using metrics like R² and MSE
- Predict values based on input features

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

To install required packages, run:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run:
-----------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/demo-linear-regression.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   cd demo-linear-regression

3. Run the main script:
   python main.py

Sample Output:
--------------
The project generates visualizations and metrics to assess the model. Plots are saved in the `images/` folder.

To Do:
------
- Add polynomial regression
- Create a simple Streamlit or Flask UI
- Deploy as a RESTful API service
